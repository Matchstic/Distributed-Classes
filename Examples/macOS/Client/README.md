Two applications are provided for macOS: an AppKit-based application, and a CLI application.

Both will automatically search for a server with the service name of "test", using the 
inter-machine API.

The CLI application includes code to show how to utilise DCNSBasicAuthentication to
use a simple username/password combo as access controls.

The AppKit application also includes code showing the global error handler in action.
