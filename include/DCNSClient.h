 Initialises the client-side of Distributed Classes to a remote server.
 @discussion If you wish to connect to a device on the local network, it may be easier to simply pass nil and 0 for `host` and `portNum` respectively. This allows Bonjour to automatically find the service requested via multicast DNS.
 @discussion IPv4 is a ridiculous nightmare; specify `host` via an IPv6 address if going for dotted notation. In addition, my code will only attempt to resolve an IPv6 address for unknown hosts.
 @param host The hostname of the server to connect to. Passing nil searches for `service` via Bonjour in the local domain.
 @param portNum The port number the remote server is listening on. Only used if `host` is non-NULL.
 @param delegate The delegate to use for authentication requests. Passing `nil` will run the system with default authentication.
 @param error Will contain any errors that arise during establishing a connection
